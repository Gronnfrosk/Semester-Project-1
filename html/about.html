						<p>
							The aim of Community Science Museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
							lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
						</p>
						<p>
							We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits
							on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science
							come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
						</p>
						<p>The entrance is free for all.</p>
						<p>
							There are guided tours of the museum that leave every hour. These tours are 70 NOK per person and include a handy printed guide of the museum.
						</p>
						<p>If you would like to organise a guided tour for your group of 6 or more people, please contact us to arrange the tour.</p>

						<h4>Support</h4>
						<p>
							There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible to
							the whole community.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some item or collection that you think others would
							enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="involved">
						<h4>Volunteer</h4>
						<p>
							A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has
							its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and
							volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
						</p>
						<p>You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="involved">
						<h4>Internship</h4>
						<p>
							Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you could be
							just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
						</p>
						<p>You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about science and sharing it with the wider community.</p>
